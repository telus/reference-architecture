## Testing 

As we move to the world of reference architecture, many questions arise in the realm of testing:

- What is testing in an RA world?
- How does that reflect my squad?

or more specifically:

- **What** needs to be tested?
- **Why** do I need to test {insert type of test}?
- **Who** needs to test {insert type of test}?
- **When** do I need to write/run {insert type of test}?

If you have, then here's the place to find your answers!

### Our philosophy on testing

- We care about the quality of our products, hence we care about testing
- Testing is a shared responsibility, not just the testers' or the developers'
- Testing is not just running the happy path, it's both **checking** the product's functionality, and **exploring** the product's potential vulnerabilities

### Testing practices

Here we lay out all the testing practices teams should be following in the RA world, whether they are automated, manually performed, [functional][functional-testing] or [non-functional][non-functional-testing]

#### Automated functional tests

These are tests that directly validates the functionality of your software / application.

- [Unit tests][unit-tests]
- [Contract tests][contract-tests]
- [E2E (functional)][e2e-functional]
- [E2E (visual validation)][e2e-ui]

#### Automated non-functional tests

These are tests that does not directly validate the functionality of your application. 

However, you should invest in these tests, **because** usersâ€™ affection and trust of a software or system is swayed and affected by these non-functional qualities. (Just imagine if Google takes 10 seconds to load your search results, or your Gmail password gets hacked every so often, would you trust their service still?)
