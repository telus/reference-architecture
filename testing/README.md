## Testing (in an RA world)

Have you asked the following questions: 

- __What__ needs to be tested?
- __Who__ needs to test {insert type of test}?
- __Why__ do I need to test {insert type of test}?
- __When__ do I need to test/write the test {insert type of test}?

If you have, then here's the place to find your answers!

### Automated functional tests
These are tests that directly validates the functionality of your software / application.


| What | Why | Who | When (to write) | When (to run) |
| ---- | --- | --- | --------------- | ------------- |
| [Unit tests](functional/unit.md) |[Why](functional/unit.md#why)| Developers | Ideally, before you write the actual code, as we want to follow the [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) practice| As part of the delivery pipeline, through [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). Ref: [starter-kit: docker#unit test](https://github.com/telusdigital/telus-isomorphic-starter-kit/blob/6226eeb9998247eed430ddf686028a992f115dfc/DOCKER.md#unit-testing) |
| [Contract tests](functional/consumer_driven_contracts.md) | [Why](functional/consumer_driven_contracts.md#illustrating-the-problem) | Developers | During feature/story development | As part of the delivery pipeline |
| [E2E (functional)](functional/e2e.md) | [Why](functional/e2e.md#why) | Testers | Ideally, if [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) done right: after the UAT is defined in story. (Realistically: after application is built) | A lightweight E2E smoke test suite should be run as part of the delivery pipeline, a more robust regression suite should be run on a daily basis (assuming [CI](../process/continuous-integration.md)) |
| [E2E (UI)](functional/visual-regression.md) | [Why](functional/visual-regression.md#why) | Testers | Currently, only need to define the delta as part of starter-kit, after story complete  | As part of the delivery pipeline, through [starter-kit: visual regression](https://github.com/telusdigital/telus-isomorphic-starter-kit/blob/6226eeb9998247eed430ddf686028a992f115dfc/e2e/test/assertions/compareScreenshot.js) |

### Automated non-functional tests
These are tests that does not directly validate the functionality of your application. 

However, you should invest in these tests, __because__ usersâ€™ affection and trust of a software or system is swayed and affected by these non-functional qualities. (Just imagine if Google takes 10 seconds to load your search results, or your Gmail password gets hacked every so often, would you trust their service still?)
