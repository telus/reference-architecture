## Testing 

As we move to the world of reference architecture, many questions arise in the realm of testing:

- What is testing in an RA world?
- How does that reflect my squad?

or more specifically:

- __What__ needs to be tested?
- __Why__ do I need to test {insert type of test}?
- __Who__ needs to test {insert type of test}?
- __When__ do I need to write/run {insert type of test}?

If you have, then here's the place to find your answers!

### Our philosophy on testing

- We care about the quality of our products, hence we care about testing
- Testing is a shared responsibility, not just the testers' or the developers'
- Testing is not just running the happy path, it's both __checking__ the product's functionality, and __exploring__ the product's potential vulnerabilities

### Testing practices

Here we lay out all the testing practices teams should be following in the RA world, whether they are automated, manually performed, [functional][Functional testing] or [non-functional][Non-functional testing]

#### *Automated functional tests*
These are tests that directly validates the functionality of your software / application.
- [Unit tests][Unit tests]
- [Contract tests][Contract tests]
- [E2E (functional)][E2E functional]
- [E2E (visual validation)][E2E ui]

---

#### *Automated non-functional tests*
These are tests that does not directly validate the functionality of your application. 

However, you should invest in these tests, __because__ usersâ€™ affection and trust of a software or system is swayed and affected by these non-functional qualities. (Just imagine if Google takes 10 seconds to load your search results, or your Gmail password gets hacked every so often, would you trust their service still?)
