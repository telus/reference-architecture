# Mailinator

## Why

- In some customer experiences, My TELUS is sending some emails to the customers for some interaction, e.g. 2-factor authentication in the registration process or email address validation.
- In order to complete a full E2E automation test, we need a solution to let our script getting access easily to the inbox, grab the content of the emailâ€™s body, fetch it to retrieve the dynamic value (it could be a passcode or a URL) and then complete the flow as a customer would do. 
- Using a cloud service instead of an in-house solution to be more cost-effective from a maintenance and scalability point of view
