# Devicefarm

## Why

We are living in a mobile-first world, reflected by our TELUS.com and My Account app customers: 

- Web with ~ 61% traffic (filtering Samsung default browser traffic) coming from mobile devices. Src: [Domo][domo: mobile vs desktop], Aug/17 data
- My Account has 630k from native app. Src: [Domo][domo:my account active user], Aug/17 data

As such, leveraging real devices (see why not emulators and simulators in [FAQ][devicefarm faq]) to mimic and test end-to-end use cases should be an essential part of the quality assurance scope, which aligns with the TELUS Digital principles:

- Mobile first - simplicity
- End-to-end experiences

## What

Devicefarm is a platform aiming to provide teams with real mobile automation and manual testing environments / capabilities.

It consists of infrastructure and software layers that we built from ground up, utilizing open source projects such as Selenium and Appium.

It is a huge step in the mobile-first initiative, we hope to raise visibility, awareness, and empower teams to improve their mobile testing through this project.

In terms of features, it aims to provide

- Manual physical testing inventory
- Automation test run environment (beta)
- Sync browsing capabilities (alpha)
- A collaboration space for team members to work with mobile

And more coming soon<sup>TM</sup>!

You can also join **#devicefarm** on slack to get access to [livestream][df livestream] of the devicefarm in Toronto to get a sneak peak!

## How (and benefits)

### Hardware/infrastructure

We have:

- Wall fixture w/ devices secured in front, and shelving area as work station, standing or sitting! ![][df media: frontview]
- Mac mini servers powering automation system ft. security alarm![][df media: servers and alarm]
- Additional security w/ Nest cam![][df media: nestcam]

### Software/framework

We have [farmville][farmville] which provides

- Web automation environment via Selenium/Appium + Nightwatch(or any other testing framework working)
  - Visually, it looks like ![][df media: webapp]
  - Benefits: 
    - By running automated web tests on the devicefarm, teams can quickly gain a sense of their app's performance on different devices/operating systems/screensizes. These automated tests (when written properly) have rapid feedback, high accuracy, low false positives, and most importantly frees up team members to focus their testing on the non-repetitive and meaningful exploration.
    - Devicefarm is placed in an open area, having your apps running against it is a great way to showcase and promote your work, and potentially giving other teams inspiration how to create theirs.
- Native app automation environment, via Expresso/XCUITest
  - Visually, it looks like ![][df media: app]
  - Benefits:
    - Similar to web automation, but focusing on native apps
- Sync browsing (action on one device, and it will be performed across all devices)
  - Visually, it looks like ![][df media: sync]
  - Benefits:
    - Exploratory testing across multiple devices at the same time! Great tool for testers and POs!
    - Multi-threaded visual validation for both published apps and in dev apps! Great tool for designers and front-end devs!
- And of course, manual testing inventory:
  - Visual demonstration by the Mobility GTM team on their iPhone launch prep: ![][df media: mobility]
  - Benefits:
    - Providing a physical inventory for teams to do ad hoc/exploratory testing with real devices
