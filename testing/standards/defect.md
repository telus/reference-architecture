# Defect streamlining via JIRA - TD Defect issue type

## Why


## What
Initialtive doc:
```
In Q4 2016, we started an initiative of using JIRA (on cloud: https://telusdigital.atlassian.net) and issue type “TD Defect” for our defect tracking. We did a test run and improved based on feedback. We also announced the initiative in two of our QA weekly guild meetings.

Starting 2017, we need to streamline our defect tracking process for consistency and reporting purposes. And we will be doing so through the use of above cloud JIRA and “TD Defect”.

Here are the action items (for the person in charge of defect management):
If you are already using cloud JIRA, the JIRA project admin of each squad need to:
Enable “TD Defect” issue type for your project by following this document. If you do not have JIRA admin rights, let me know https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnsCCp0q7grCmi2nRqOB0-Cnhd1mMBox7uhUSg1EB2k/editand I can help with getting you access.
Update your squad info here.
Move all 2017 open defects to "TD Defect", you can do so via the "Move" option when viewing an issue.
If you are not using cloud JIRA already, and have NO difficulties moving to cloud JIRA, please start the migration. Meaning: Get cloud JIRA account, create a project for your squad, and follow the 3 steps under the first bullet point.
If you are not using cloud JIRA already, and have difficulties moving to cloud JIRA, please add your squad info and state the reason(s) here in the “Reasons for not able to switch to Cloud JIRA” column, and we will evaluate your situation.

Please complete the above tasks (enable TD Defect / Migrate to cloud JIRA / State reasons) by:
Friday, Jan 20th, 2017

If you have any feedback or questions, please contact ben.chen@telus.com.
Audit will be conducted the following week, if no actions taken, corresponding escalations will take place.

Frequently asked questions:

Q: What does it mean that we need to use “TD Defect” in cloud JIRA?
A: If you are using https://telusdigital.atlassian.net (a.k.a cloud JIRA), when creating a defect for your project, use issue type “TD Defect” instead of “Bug”.

Q: “TD Defect” is not showing up when I create issue?
A: That’s because it’s not configured for your project, refer to this doc for instructions.

Q: I want to move to cloud Jira but I don’t have an account/project?
A: If you have a telus email then you will be able to create accounts on https://telusdigital.atlassian.net. Once in, you should be able to create project(s) for your squad. If you have access issues, let me know.

Q: Do I need to move EVERYTHING from my old system to cloud JIRA for migration?
A: No, just all existing open defects from 2017 (not stories or tasks or anything opened in 2016 and prior).

Q: What is "all existing open defects from 2017" ?
A: All defects found in 2017 that have not been resolved.
