# Defect streamlining via JIRA - TD Defect issue type

## Why

We didn't have a single source of truth to capture all necessary data to properly report a defect. 

## What

Ensure all teams move to JIRA, and all projects in JIRA use a particular issue type "TD Defect" for logging bugs.

TD Defect has more comprehensive fields to capture data such as:

## FAQ
Frequently asked questions:

Q: What does it mean that we need to use “TD Defect” in cloud JIRA?
A: If you are using https://telusdigital.atlassian.net (a.k.a cloud JIRA), when creating a defect for your project, use issue type “TD Defect” instead of “Bug”.

Q: “TD Defect” is not showing up when I create issue?
A: That’s because it’s not configured for your project, refer to this doc for instructions.

Q: I want to move to cloud Jira but I don’t have an account/project?
A: If you have a telus email then you will be able to create accounts on https://telusdigital.atlassian.net. Once in, you should be able to create project(s) for your squad. If you have access issues, let me know.

Q: Do I need to move EVERYTHING from my old system to cloud JIRA for migration?
A: No, just all existing open defects from 2017 (not stories or tasks or anything opened in 2016 and prior).

Q: What is "all existing open defects from 2017" ?
A: All defects found in 2017 that have not been resolved.
