# Unit testing

## Why

When designing or implementing a feature, we want to know that we are doing it properly. Once the feature is implemented, we want to ensure that it keeps working.

## What

As part of our [Continuous Integration](../process/continuous-integration.md) practices, we are pushing for Test Driven Development, where unit tests are written BEFORE a new feature. It falls in line with the construction proverb: "measure twice, cut once".

By writing the test first:

- Ensures the code is loosely coupled
- Your code evolves in small steps
- You get automated regression testing
- You get living documentation as to how the system works
- etc.

## How

- Start with your test first, to ensure that the test fails
- Implement the feature that makes the test pass
- Avoid [fragile tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M) and tight coupling

## Style

For testing React higher order components, it is preferred to keep the presentational component and the enhancing container in separate source files, then wrap in `index.js` to export the enhanced component. This way, testing can be done separately on the presentational component, and then the higher order component, without adding in extra named exports.

ie: Given a `Card` that gets wrapped in an HoC, the directory structure should look as follows:
```
- Card/
  - __tests__/
    - Card.spec.jsx
    - EnhancedCard.spec.jsx
  - Card.jsx
  - EnhancedCard.jsx
  - index.js
```
