# Contribution Guide

> Shamelessly borrowed from [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) with modification to fit our context.

You've found an opportunity to improve our technology standards, and you're ready to make a contribution. Finally! Here's how to get your contribution in the right way.

## Communicating effectively

Whether you're a one-time contributor or a long standing member of the team, working with others is one of the most important skills you'll need to be successful in our team and our industry overall.

Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively:

**Give context.** Help others get quickly up to speed. If you're running into an error, explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you're suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it'd be useful to the project (not just to you!).

> ðŸ˜‡ _"X doesn't happen when I do Y"_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _"X is broken! Please fix it."_

**Do your homework beforehand.** It's OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check for existing documentation, issues (open or closed), and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you're trying to learn.

> ðŸ˜‡ _"I'm not sure how to implement X. I checked the help docs and didn't find any mentions."_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _"How do I X?"_

**Keep requests short and direct.** Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else's review. Be concise and patient, this will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.

> ðŸ˜‡ _"I'd like to write an API tutorial."_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _"I was driving down the highway the other day and stopped for gas, and then I had this amazing idea for something we should be doing, but before I explain that, let me show you..."_

**Keep all communication public.** Unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security and privacy issue, or a serious concern to the business), keep the conversation public. By doing so, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.

> ðŸ˜‡ _(as a comment) "@-maintainer Hi there! How should we proceed on this PR?"_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _(as an email) "Hey there, sorry to bother you over email, but I was wondering if you've had a chance to review my PR"_

**It's okay to ask questions (but be patient!).** Everybody was new to the team at some point, and even experienced team members needing to get up to speed when they look at a new project. By the same token, even longtime team members are not always familiar with every part of the project. Show them the same patience that you'd want them to show you.

> ðŸ˜‡ _"Thanks for looking into this error. I followed your suggestions. Here's the output."_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _"Why can't you fix my problem? Isn't this your project?"_

**Respect team decisions.** Your ideas may differ from the team's priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, the business will have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with the team direction, you can always ask for clarification with the team leads and Principal Architect.

> ðŸ˜‡ _"I'm disappointed you can't support my use case, but as you've explained it only affects a minor portion of use-cases, I understand why. Thanks for listening."_
>
> ðŸ˜¢ _"Why won't you support my use case? This is unacceptable!"_

**Above all, keep it classy.** Context gets lost across squads, teams, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It's fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the technology and technologists in a better place than when you joined.

## Gathering context

Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your contribution hasn't been discussed. Skim the existing documentation, issues _(open and closed)_. You don't have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.

If you can't find any reference to your contribution, you're ready to make a move. You'll likely communicate by opening an issue or pull request:

- **Issues** are like starting a conversation or discussion
- **Pull requests** are for starting work on a standards proposal
- **For lightweight communication,** such as a clarifying or how-to question, try asking on Slack.

## Opening an issue

You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

- Report an problem you or your squad has faced and can't solve yourself
- Discuss a high-level topic or idea (ex. standards, policies)

Tips for communicating on issues:

- **If you see an open issue that you want to tackle,** comment on the issue to let people know you're on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
- **If an issue was opened a while ago,** it's possible that it's being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
- **If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own,** comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.

## Opening a pull request

You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:

- Submit trivial fixes (ex. a typo, broken link, or obvious error)
- Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you've already discussed, in an issue

A pull request doesn't have to represent finished work. It's usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a "WIP" (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

As your write commits, be sure to check the [pull request template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for guidance.

## What happens after you submit a contribution

You did it! Congratulations on becoming a contributor. We hope it's the first of many.

After you submit a contribution, one of the following will happen:

### ðŸ˜­ You don't get a response

If you haven't gotten a response in over a week, it's fair to politely respond in that same thread, asking someone for a review. If you know the name of the right person to review your contribution, you can @-mention them in that thread.

**Don't** reach out to that person privately; remember that public communication is vital to increased productivity and visibility.

### ðŸš§ Someone requests changes to your contribution

It's common that you'll be asked to make changes to your contribution, whether that's feedback on the scope of your idea, or changes to your writing.

When someone requests changes, be responsive. They've taken the time to review your contribution. Opening a PR and walking away is bad form. If you don't know how to make changes, ask for help.

If you don't have time to work on the issue anymore (for example, if the conversation has been going on for a while, and your circumstances have changed), let the team know so they're not expecting a response. Someone else may be happy to take over.

### ðŸ‘Ž Your contribution doesn't get accepted

Your contribution may or may not be accepted in the end. Hopefully you didn't put too much work into it already. If you're not sure why it wasn't accepted, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for feedback and clarification. Ultimately, however, you'll need to respect that this is the team's decision.

### ðŸŽ‰ Your contribution gets accepted

Hooray! You've successfully made a contribution!

Don't forget to say thanks when a team member put effort into helping you. Our entire work is made by people like you: one issue, pull request, comment, or high-five at a time.
