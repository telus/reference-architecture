# Analytics

## Why

To measure KPIs we leverage Adobe Analytics for web and mobile app data collection across TELUS. 

## What

Adobe Analytics provides the space to store, query and visualize data.
Adobe DTM or Adobe Launch is a separate space, which specifies what and when data is sent to Adobe Analytics.
(Adobe Launch is the tag manager we are migrating towards)

## How
In addition to the Adobe tools above, every page needs a `dataLayer` object, which represents what data is available for sending to Adobe Analytics. As a tag manager like Adobe DTM or Adobe Launch is loaded on page, code will run to check for `dataLayer` and send a pageview as result. Nowadays, especially with SPA behavior, `dataLayer` needs to be updated as user interacts with page and cause DOM pages.
