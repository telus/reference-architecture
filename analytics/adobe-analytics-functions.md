# Adobe Analytics Functions

## Why
Existing analytics tagging depends on an out-of-box Adobe functionality to detect when `dataLayer` object changes.
This detection is a black-box and does not meet our requirements as users can trigger many changes quickly. 
To avoid delaying when we set `datalayer`, we are exposing few methods to call to trigger hits directly.

## Caveat

This section will be updated as we extend more functionality.

- Check page is loading **Adobe DTM**, and not Adobe Launch. This is verified by looking for scripts src containing `adobedtm` and not `launch`.
  We will enable the same function in Adobe Launch in near future.
- Check `dataLayer.product` is populated as expected
- Use try-catch just in case Adobe DTM is not loaded.
- Ensure there is no updates to `dataLayer.event` when using any functions below.
- Check `dataLayer` is **updated first** before calling the functions below. 

E.g.,

1. user lands on product detail page 
2. `dataLayer` is present with page level info
3. a pageview hit is sent  
4. user clicks to add product to cart
5. `dataLayer` is updated with product info
6. a function such as `add_to_cart` from list below is called
7. an event hit is sent 

## Functions

- Add to Cart
  ```js
  var s = _satellite.getToolsByType('sc')[0].getS();
  s.events="scAdd"
  s.track('add_to_cart');
  ```

- Remove from Cart
  ```js
  var s = _satellite.getToolsByType('sc')[0].getS();
  s.events="scRemove"
  s.track('remove_from_cart');
  ```

## Notes
- Naming conventions for values inside `s.events` are all out-of-box and can't be changed. 
- Naming conventions for values in `s.track` are customized and typically start with a verb.
