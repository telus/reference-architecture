# API Practice Roadmap

The work of the API Practice is divided into three themes:

* **People and Culture**: Outcomes around the people side of the API Practice -- ceremonies, education, events, etc.
* **Documentation and Process**: Outcomes around API Practice processes and documentation -- onboarding teams, educating developers, cataloging services, standards, etc.
* **Technology and Support**: Outcomes around the technical content of the API Practice -- supporting development projects, operationalizing API-specific infrastructure, building shared APIs and services, etc.

**SMART goals** around these themes are defined. **Metrics** are defined to measure progress against goals.

The themes are then decomposed into **epics**. Epics are collections of stories which attempt to achieve the defined goals. Epics can cross themes, and so themes are implemented as JIRA labels.

Progress of epics is monitored by progress through the story backlog and through regular examination, or dashboarding, of defined metrics.

Progress is reported weekly in **Wolfpack Showcase** and bi-weekly in **API Forum**, where the backlog is examined in detail. Dashboards will be available for realtime updates.
