## API Non-Functional Requirement Standards

### Why

This document contains documentation related to non-functional API standards within TELUS Digital.

It is a proof of concept of the architectural standards process and is, itself, a work in progress.

### What

#### Functional versus Non-Functional Requirements

- Functional requirements are business requirements. They are what an API does.
- Non-Functional requirement are technical requirements. They are how an API performs its functional requirements.

#### Canonical NFRs

[The Wikipedia list of Non-Functional Requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) is used as a baseline.

#### Accessibilty

Accessibility is a user interface NFR, and so is unrelated to APIs, which are system interfaces.

That being said, accessibility MUST be considered when authoring API documentation. Open API dynamic documentation, developer guides, and similar documents, SHOULD strive for greater than double-A WCAG 2.1 support.

Greater than double-AA WCAG 2.1 support is the TELUS Digital UX standard at this writing. Updates to that standard supersede this standard.

### When

Continuous.

### How

This document defines the above standards. They are discussed through [the API Tools & Practices forum](https://github.com/telus/api-tools-and-practices-docs/issues).

### Who

No longer any owners.
