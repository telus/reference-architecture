# API Accessibility Requirements

This document codifies Accessibility requirements for the Telus Digital API Practice.

## Documentation

API documentation must be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant as [checked by WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/).

## Implementation

API endpoints must be well documented both in comments, docs, and Swagger OpenAPI definitions. Swagger files should be generated from code and contain positive and negative example invocations.
