## Why

For new and existing team members & partners, a single place where all the technical knowledge and platform specifications can be documented, tracked and debated.

## What

### Table of Content

- [Development](development/README.md)
- [Process](process/README.md)
- [API Platform](api/README.md)
- [Testing](testing/README.md)
- [Delivery](delivery/README.md)
- [Security](security/README.md)
- [Performance](performance/README.md)
- [How do I...](how-do-i/README.md)

### How do I...

The documentation linked above is very deep and detailed, which isn't always the best way to find what you're looking for. Make sure to check the [How do I...](how-do-i/) section to find direct answers to objective questions!

## How

A *thin* and simple format documentation for technical resources, tools, platforms and decisions. Members can quickly and easily get context on "Why, What & How" for every part of our platform

A Public Github repository, with Markdown articles as content, (using the repository itself, rather than the "Github Wikis" Feature, this ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of github git gui features (blame, history, branches, diff, etc ...)
- publish into a static website using Github Pages
- leverage branch locking and other Github features only available in content repos

The format should follow [this template](.template.md)

### Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
