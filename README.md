> This is a collaborative effort to document our digital standards, tooling and process, you are welcome to contribute and suggest changes, please follow the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Why

For new and existing team members & partners, a single place where all the technical knowledge and platform specifications can be documented, tracked and debated.

## How

A *thin* and simple format documentation for technical resources, tools, platforms and decisions. Members can quickly and easily get context on "Why, What & How" for every part of our platform

A Public Github repository, with Markdown articles as content, (using the repository itself, rather than the "Github Wikis" Feature, this ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of github git gui features (blame, history, branches, diff, etc ...)
- publish into a static website using Github Pages
- leverage branch locking and other Github features only available in content repos

The format should follow [this template](.template.md)

### Principles

We embrace a number of principles that inform our technical practices and provide context for the reference architecture. They are rooted in the "DevOps" movement that have had a transformative effect in recent years on technical and business practice.

#### Culture

If culture may be considered as a "totality of social habits", we are selecting and continually refining a collection of habits that lead to the business outcomes we desire and cultivate the atmosphere in which we wish to work. A major goal is the elimination of barriers between teams; communication should be fluid, inquisitiveness encouraged, and discovery of information near effortless. We adopt a scientific posture with respect to our work and consider it an achievement to "fail fast". There is no stigma attached to unsuccessful experiments.

#### Automation

Human time and attention is our most valuable resource, and it is best spent on things that only humans can do. Whenever possible we eliminate repetitive tasks to free up human attention by creating programs to do those tasks for us. This increases speed and consistency, leading to productivity gains, while permitting self-service. Automation is all-pervasive; everything from on-boarding to software deployments is in scope and improvements are accepted from all quarters. Automation helps us encourage the adoption of the reference architecture by providing an easy path to adoption. By creating tooling that is highly integrated with our infrastructure, we aim to keep the time required to go from project start to initial production deployment on the order of minutes, and to support that pace for subsequent releases.

#### Measurement

Our team strives towards a common set of goals. To determine our progress we devise ways to measure the things that we do. We instrument our tools and applications to enable the collection of meaningful data about our performance. Data is visualized for ready comprehension, available in raw formats for custom analysis, and is made broadly accessible to all parts of the organization. This allows us to make data-driven decisions with less bias and subjectivity.

#### Sharing

We value transparency. Our standards, practices, tools, and outcomes are shared widely. We know that others face similar challenges to us and realize that as an organization we can increase efficiency by reducing duplication and surfacing opportunities for collaboration. We aim to learn from others, both within and outside TELUS. As proponents and users of open source software we wish to be active and engaged participants in the ecosystems producing the tools and technologies that we use.

#### Scaling

We are growing to serve the needs of our customers, both internal and external, and realize that we need to be smart about scaling to realize the ambitious scope of our mandate.
