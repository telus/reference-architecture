## Why

> _Why does this exist?_

This wiki acts as a source of truth for all the technical knowledge, software specifications, standards and architecture evolution.

This is a collaborative effort to **document**, **track**, and **discuss** digital software standards, tooling and practices, you are welcome to contribute and suggest changes, please follow the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and keep in mind: _this repository is [**Open Source**](#open-source)_.

## Who

> _Who is this for?_

- **Existing _Team Members_**: use as a reference, and contribute updates
- **New & Future _Team Members_**: learn about our software development standards and practices
- **Partners**: get familiar with our software standards and practices prior to project delivery commitments

## What

> _What is the structure?_

This is a **Public** & [**Open Source**](#open-source) repository, with articles written in Markdown denoting various topics in the following categories:

- [Development](development/README.md)
- [Process](process/README.md)
- [API Platform](api/README.md)
- [Testing](testing/README.md)
- [Delivery](delivery/README.md)
- [Security](security/README.md)
- [Performance](performance/README.md)
- [Analytics](analytics/README.md)
- [Hardware & Tooling](equipment/README.md)

A _thin_ and simple documentation format for technical resources, tools, platforms and decisions. Members can quickly and easily get context on _"Why, What & How"_ for every part of our software standards.

## How

> _How to take part?_

### Embody our [Principles][digital-principles]

- Focus on Customer First
- Value data over opinions
- Deliver outcomes over outputs
- Take risks and be lean
- Build for quality and reuse
- Be an owner
- Attract and develop leaders
- Embrace inclusivity
- Strengthen communities

### Open Source

Because we love our customers and we love our technology, we are evolving it, in full transparency!

<!--lint disable no-emphasis-as-heading-->
**We do all of this in public to truly embrace our _customer first_ principles**

In order to achieve this, we ensure no sensitive content ins included, such as:

- security & privacy policy violating content
- content considered competitive intelligence
- keys, tokens or credentials

### Process & Contribution

A few avenues are made available for ensuring open collaboration and extended support for contributions to this standards wiki:

- [**Technology Forum**][technology-forum]  
  As a TELUS team member, you are welcome to use _The Technology Forum_ as **the official process** to guide conversations and discussions around technology solutions, ideas, issue escalation, questions, knowledge sharing, and Reference Architecture evolution.

  > We keep these two repositories separate, since this one is meant to be public and Open Source, whereas the Technology Forum will involve deep technical discussions and private information.

- **Open Contribution**  
  Simply use GitHub to make new pull-requests, start discussions, and contribute to active ones.  
  However, if your contribution was not addressed in _The Technology Forum_ the likelihood of adopting your suggested changes is minimal.

### Format

All topics MUST follow the format outlined in this [this template](.template.md)

### GitHub

Using the GitHub repository itself, rather than the "GitHub Wikis" feature, or other "Wiki" software ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of GitHub GUI features _(blame, history, branches, diff, etc ...)_
- ability to publish into a static website using GitHub Pages
- leverage branch locking, testing automation and other GitHub features only available in repos

### Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14][bcp14] [[RFC2119][rfc2119]] [[RFC8174][rfc8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
