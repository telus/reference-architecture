### Embody our [Principles][digital-principles]

- Focus on Customer First
- Value data over opinions
- Deliver outcomes over outputs
- Take risks and be lean
- Build for quality and reuse
- Be an owner
- Attract and develop leaders
- Embrace inclusivity
- Strengthen communities

### Open Source

Because we love our customers and we love our technology, we are evolving it, in full transparency!

<!--lint disable no-emphasis-as-heading-->
**We do all of this in public to truly embrace our _customer first_ principles**

In order to achieve this, we ensure no sensitive content is included, such as:

- security & privacy policy violating content
- content considered competitive intelligence
- keys, tokens or credentials

### Process & Contribution

To ensure open collaboration and support for wiki contributions, a few avenues are made available:

- [**Technology Forum**][technology-forum]  
  The Technology Forum is the official discussion board for conversations around
  technology solutions, ideas, issue escalations, questions, knowledge sharing,
  and Reference Architecture evolution.

  > Since Reference Architecture is open source, we separated Technology Forum into
  > its own private repository for deep technical discussions and confidential information.

- **Open Contribution**  
  Use GitHub to create pull-requests, start discussions, and contribute to active issues.
  Your contributions should also be addressed in _The Technology Forum_ in order to be considered for adoption.

### Format

All topics MUST adhere to the format outlined in [this template](.template.md)

### GitHub

Using the GitHub repository itself, rather than the "GitHub Wikis" feature, or other "Wiki" software ensures:

- version tracking, and usage of GitHub GUI features _(blame, history, branches, diff, etc ...)_
- ability to publish into a static website using GitHub Pages
- leverage branch locking, testing automation and other GitHub features only available in repos

### Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14][bcp14] [[RFC2119][rfc2119]] [[RFC8174][rfc8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
