# Introductory 1:1 Meetings

## Why

As a leader, its important to get to know the people you serve. Developing a relationship outside of the transactional day to day gives you a space for coaching.

## How
 
Have somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes. 45 minutes is about perfect.
Have some kind of privacy. Sometimes I do these over coffee or lunch, a meeting room will also work fine.
 
Start by asking about goals. Short term, medium term, or long term. I often start by asking "Tell me about your goals - do you want to be Prime Minister some day? Do you want to learn a language? Do you want pizza for lunch?" I don't set an expectation that I will get them to those goals, though I do acknowledge that if I know what their goals are, it becomes possible for me to do small things to help get them there. This also helps set the scene for the rest of the conversation, and helps me get to know the other person.
 
Next, get pull feedback. If this is a first 1:1, maybe they are new to the team, or maybe you are. Ask them how its going so far for them, ask them about what issues they may have spotted that need resolution. Give them ample time to open up, ask them for more details about what they're saying. Try to paraphrase what they are saying back to them, ask if you've understood it properly. Try hard not to defend what's going on, or even try to solve it, mostly just listen. If there's an explanation, go ahead and offer it, but make sure to validate what they're saying too.
 
Finish with any push feedback. Try to think about what feedback you may have for them so far, both celebratory and critical. You can often present this in context of their goals... "you mentioned you were interested in pursuing tech lead goals - here's one thing I've noticed that can help you get to the next level with that..."
