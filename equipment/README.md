# Hardware & Tooling Requirements - Developers

## Why

To optimize for maximum productivity we need to ensure consistency in what we offer our developers in terms of hardware requirements for developing on the [Digital Platform](digital-paltform.md). At the same time, by offering our employees all of the equipment and tooling needed, we will make it unlikely for them to have to bring their own personal equipment to the office and hence avoid any potential security issues.

## How

List of recommended hardware & software requirements that all of our developers should have access to to allow for a good, highly productive setup. Our People Experience team & Hiring Managers should refer to this list as they prepare for on-boarding our new developer hires.

The hardware and tooling requirements below reflect an evolving standard. At TELUS Digital, we make ongoing efforts to refresh hardware where possible to adhere to revisions in our standards for existing team members.
