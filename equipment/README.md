## Hardware & Tooling Requirements - Developers

_Last updated: August 2018_

### Why


We want to ensure consistency in what we offer our developers in terms of hardware and software, so as to allow for maximum productivity. At the same time, by offering our employees all of the equipment and tooling needed, we will make it unlikely for them to have to bring their own personal equipment to the office and hence avoid any potential security issues.

### How

We need a list of minimum hardware & software requirements that all of our developers should have access to to allow for a good, highly productive setup. Our People Experience team should refer to this list as they prepare for on-boarding our new developer hires.
