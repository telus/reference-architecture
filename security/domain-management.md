# Domain Management

TELUS digital properties are *strongly discouraged* from hosting on subdomains except in unusual circumstances requiring an exception. External TELUS digital properties and microsites must follow our standard subdomain substructure in order to ensure a consistent customer experience and maintain customer trust that they are on a TELUS websites. We do not support the use of unique domains (e.g. `telusrocks.com`) and no domains should ever be registered by third party and digital partner groups.

When requesting a TELUS subdomain, keep in mind the following:
- Subdomains must have the following format: `x.telus.com`, e.g. `community.telus.com`
- The subdomain should represent the product or campaign name as clearly as possible
- The product/campaign name as part of the subdomain should be no more than **12** characters long
- Abbreviations and hyphens SHOULD be avoided
- The use of the brand name in the first part of the subdomain is not permitted (e.g. `teluscampaign.telus.com`)
- Note: All product names must be approved through proper Brand/Marketing channels before a subdomain is set up
- The same structure requirements apply for other TELUS-owned brands (e.g. `koodo.com`, `publicmobile.ca`, `telushealth.com`, `telusinternational.com`, etc.)
- Some exceptional cases:
  - `Telus.net` - should be capitalized and limited to existing services already using it such as e-mail, TV and HSIA 
  - `Telusmobility.com` - should be capitalized and limited to existing services already using it. Storefronts have already migrated over to `telus.com`     	
  - `Mobility.ca` - domain to be used when brand agnostic domain is needed, such as on MMS client that can be installed on TELUS or Koodo devices.
