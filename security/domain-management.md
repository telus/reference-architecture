# Domain Management

## Why

In order to maintain customer trust and ensure a consistent experience when visiting TELUS digital properties it is important that the domains we use represent our brand in a positive way. We must also ensure that our domains are highly rated by search engines, easy for customers to communicate to others, and easy to remember themselves.

## What

TELUS digital properties are *strongly discouraged* from hosting on subdomains barring unusual circumstances requiring an exception. External TELUS digital properties and microsites must follow our standard subdomain substructure. We do not support the use of unique domains (e.g. `telusrocks.com`) and no domains should ever be registered by third party and digital partner groups.

## How

When requesting a TELUS subdomain, keep in mind the following:
- Subdomains must have the following format: `x.telus.com`, e.g. `community.telus.com`
- The subdomain should represent the product or campaign name as clearly as possible
- The product/campaign name as part of the subdomain should be no more than **12** characters long
- Abbreviations and hyphens SHOULD be avoided
- The use of the brand name in the first part of the subdomain is not permitted (e.g. `teluscampaign.telus.com`)
- All product names must be approved through proper Brand/Marketing channels before a subdomain is set up
- The same structure requirements apply for other TELUS-owned brands (e.g. `koodo.com`, `publicmobile.ca`, `telushealth.com`, `telusinternational.com`, etc.)
- Some exceptional cases:
  - `Telus.net` - should be capitalized and limited to existing services already using it such as e-mail, TV and HSIA 
  - `Telusmobility.com` - should be capitalized and limited to existing services already using it. Storefronts have already migrated over to `telus.com`     	
  - `Mobility.ca` - domain to be used when brand agnostic domain is needed, such as on MMS client that can be installed on TELUS or Koodo devices.
