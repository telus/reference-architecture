# Getting access to private tools and sandbox environments

## Why

This is pretty much the first step any developer new to the company needs to go through. You need to have a `@telus.com` email and your internal credentials handy.

## What

There's a CLI tool ([shippy-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@telusdigital/shippy-cli)) in the works that will automate much of this process, but it's still in beta stage and documentation is particularly lacking.

For now, you should [follow these instructions](https://github.com/telusdigital/openshift-cluster-provisioning) to get access to the provisioning platform manually.

## Who

@developers
