# How do I...

## Why

Because it can be hard to find simple answers to direct questions, especially when you're getting started in a new project, team or company.

## What

### Table of contents

- [Getting access to private tools and sandbox environments](getting-access.md)
- [Deploying to staging/production](deploying.md)
- [Starting a new project based on a starter kit](../development/starter-kits.md)
- [Creating a project using Telus Site Builder](#) _coming soon_
- [Staging/production deployment](#) _coming soon_
- [Production deployment checklist](#) _coming soon_

## How

The idea here is to point to _existing documentation_ that answers those questions, _not_ duplicating it. A short explanation can be added whenever there are gotchas or hidden details.

## Who

Everyone
